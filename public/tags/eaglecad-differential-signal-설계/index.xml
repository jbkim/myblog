&lt;p>The first step is to create and set net classes. In EAGLE go to Edit-&amp;gt;Net classes. There you can create different values for trace width and clearance. Differential pairs should have quite a big clearance to copper pours (2-3 times the track width). Therefore I entered two net classes, one for USB (#1) and one for the top copper pour (#2) as my USB signal is routed on the top layer. As you can see I entered the values from the impedance calculator in net class #1. 10mil for track width. In Clearance Matrix you tell EAGLE how much clearance the different net classes will be used by the Auto Router or differential pair routing. These settings tell EAGLE that USB traces should be separated by 6.25mil and that USB traces should have a clearance of 30 mil to the traces (copper pours) set to net class #2.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
