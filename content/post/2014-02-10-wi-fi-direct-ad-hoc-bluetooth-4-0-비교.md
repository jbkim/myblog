### Wi-Fi Direct

Wi-Fi Direct가 무엇인지를 알기쉽게 나타내는 동영상



그럼 Wi-Fi Direct와 기존 ad-hoc은 어떻게 다른가?

> **Wi-Fi Direct is not the same as ad-hoc networking**: The most significant difference between traditional ad-hoc wireless networking (traditional peer-to-peer networking) and Wi-Fi Direct is security. In Windows ad-hoc networks, the highest level of security supported is WEP in mixed client environments (Windows 7 will support WPA2 provided all adapters support it, as well). Wi-Fi Direct, as mentioned, supports WPA2. Another difference, Wi-Fi Direct devices can also simultaneously connect to existing wireless networks. More granular control and better discovery of devices also differentiate Wi-Fi Direct from ad-hoc networking
