마스터, 슬레이브의 이름에서 주는 주종관계 때문에 그동안 별 의식없이 쓰여왔던 이름들이 바뀌었다.

MOSI &#8211; COPI

MISO &#8211; CIPO

이 2가지만 기억하면 될 것 같다.

### New signal names:

  * SDO – Serial Data Out. An output signal on a device where data is sent out to another SPI device.
  * SDI – Serial Data In. An input signal on a device where data is received from another SPI device.
  * CS – Chip Select. Activated by the controller to initiate communication with a given peripheral.
  * COPI (controller out / peripheral in). For devices that can be either a controller or a peripheral; the signal on which the device sends output when acting as the controller, and receives input when acting as the peripheral.
  * CIPO (controller in / peripheral out). For devices that can be either a controller or a peripheral; the signal on which the device receives input when acting as the controller, and sends output when acting as the peripheral.
  * SDIO – Serial Data In/Out. A bi-directional serial signal.

### Deprecated signal names:

  * MOSI – Master Out Slave In
  * MISO – Master In Slave Out
  * SS – Slave Select
  * MOMI – Master Out Master In
  * SOSI – Slave Out Slave In

### Signal names unchanged:

  * SCK – Serial Clock. The clock for the bus generated by the controller.
