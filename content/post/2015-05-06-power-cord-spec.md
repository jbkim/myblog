### H05VV-F &#8211; HAR, PVC, Light-Duty, 500 Volt

H05VV-F is a harmonized, light duty, oil-resistant, flexible, PVC multi-conductor 500-volt European cord. Recommended for use in connecting small electrical appliances under medium mechanical stress environments as in offices, kitchens and households. H05VV-F can commonly be found in connections in damp and wet areas as in refrigerators, washing machines and spin-dryers. These cables are suitable to be used in cooking and heating apparatus if there is no actual direct contact with the hot parts or other heat influences. These cables are also suitable for fixed applications in furniture, wall partitions, decoration coverings and in hollow spaces of prefabricated building parts. Available in black, white or gray jacket. Max operating voltage in single or three phase system is Uo/U 318/550 volts. In a direct system, max operating voltage is Uo/U 413/825 volts. Outdoor installation is not permitted.
