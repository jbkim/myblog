오픈소스 IoT 프레임워크

  * <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/kura/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipse Kura</a> 
      * Kura requires developers to create their own source code without a visual designer, so you’ll get more customization but also a significantly higher learning curve.
      * Kura does have a web UI for configuration of the protocols and devices connected to your network, and this also includes options for data and cloud services, and other I/O integration.
      * Uses a multi-service gateway with an online/offline mode and can manage applications and network connectivity.
      * Runs on a wide range of edge, container, cloud, or premise platforms.
  * <a href="https://nodered.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node-RED</a> 
      * Easy, beginner-friendly installation.
      * Uses color-coded boxes and wiring connections to visualize your web of networked devices.
      * Leverages IBM Bluemix cloud with native integration.
      * Runs on a wide range of edge, container, cloud, or premise platforms.
  * <a href="http://www.flogo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flogo</a> 
      * Easy installation and integration workflow.
      * Color-coded visual designer equally suited to specialists and non-specialists.
      * Flows are shareable as JSON files or strings.
      * Also runs on a wide range of edge, container, cloud, or premise platforms.
